# Tree Metrics Visualization Dashboard

This Dash web application allows users to explore and visualize tree-related data by interacting with multiple features such as `Genus`, `Species`, `Common Name`, and `Tree Type`. Users can analyze various metrics like tree height, diameter, and other metrics on interactive charts, including scatter plots and geo-plots. The app supports dynamic filtering and visualizations for deeper insights into tree distribution across various geographical locations.

## Features

- **Interactive Scatter Plot**: Visualize the distribution of trees based on selected features and metrics.
- **Geo Plot**: Display trees on an interactive map with dynamic zoom and animation based on selected metrics.
- **Multiple Metrics**: Switch between various metrics (e.g., height, diameter) for visual comparison.
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Use dropdown menus to filter by `Genus`, `Species`, `Common Name`, or `Tree Type`.
- **Animation**: Smooth transitions for the visualizations based on the selected metric.
